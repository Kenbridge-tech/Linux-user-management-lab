# Linux-user-management-lab

This lab project is part my Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate coursework, where I explored authentication and access management in Linux.

In this simulation, I practice some real-world tasks that security analysts handle every day. These practices gave me hands-on experience with:

- Setting up and securing user authentication

- Managing file permissions with the right level of access

- Applying the principle of least privilege in practice

- Properly deprovisioning accounts when users leave

## Project Overview:

In this lab, I went through the complete lifecycle of a Linux user account:

Onboarding: Created a new user and placed them in the right group for their role.

Access Management: Assigned file ownership so they could contribute to a project securely.

Role Change: Adjusted their access permissions when their responsibilities changed.

Offboarding: Safely removed the user account once they left the organization.
